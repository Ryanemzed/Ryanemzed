Hi, I like to dink around with controllers and hand tools, and I really like Super Smash Bros. Melee.

I've been monkeying around with controllers for many years not knowing what I'm doing, and now I'm still doing that but surrounded by people who DO know what they're doing. ;)

I'm learning slowly how to improve my drafting and design skills, and am mostly focused on trying as many new things as I can with my builds to be able to advise others on what works and what doesn't.

I'm excited to collaborate with people on how to make high quality digital controllers more accessible, how to make beautiful digital controllers mixing organic and synthetic materials, and communicating this knowledge in a way that is accessible, detailed, and focused on what matters most when working on one's own designs.

I'm Ryanemzed, and while I've learned many things in my life, the one thing I know for sure is that I know nothing.

And that Melee is sick.
